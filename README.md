# 401k-contribution-outlook
An interactive single-page web application that allows users to manage their 401(k) retirement contributions. Users can select a contribution type (fixed dollar amount or percentage of paycheck), adjust their contribution rate, and view mock Year-to-Date (YTD) contribution data. The app provides a realistic, frontend-only experience of how contribution changes impact long-term retirement savings.

## 🚀 Features
- Set Contribution Type — Choose between a fixed dollar amount or a percentage of your paycheck.

- Adjust Contribution Rate — Use an intuitive slider or input field to set your desired contribution.

- View Mock Data — See a simulated salary, YTD contributions, and current savings details.

- Projected Savings (Optional) — Visualize how small changes to your contribution rate can affect savings at retirement.

- Frontend Only — All data is mocked on the client side; no backend required.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Framework: React + TypeScript

- Styling: CSS

- Data: Mocked in code (no external API or backend)
